# Maven Clinic Incident Response & Review (Practice Scenario)

## Overview

This repository contains a **Post-Incident Review Report** for a simulated unusual network activity incident at Maven Clinic. The report follows the **NIST Incident Response Process Framework**, detailing the steps taken to handle and mitigate the incident in a **practice scenario**.

This scenario was part of a learning experience designed to simulate real-world cybersecurity challenges in a healthcare setting.

### Key Sections:

- **Incident Timeline**: Detailed breakdown from detection to resolution with specific timestamps.
- **Security Review**: Analysis of what went right and areas for improvement.
- **Systems & Services Impact**: Highlighting which systems were affected and how services were impacted.
- **Business Impact & Legal Implications**: Evaluating potential financial and reputational risk, including HIPAA compliance.
- **Communication Effectiveness**: Internal and external communication strategies during the incident.
- **Lessons Learned & Preventive Measures**: Critical takeaways from the incident and future security investments.

## Learning Experience

This report was created as part of the **Clicked Incident Response and Review Mini Sprint (9/23/24)**, a hands-on learning experience where participants stepped into the role of cybersecurity professionals to practice managing and mitigating security incidents.

### Learning Objectives:
- Use the **NIST Incident Response Process** to handle and mitigate simulated threats.
- Create comprehensive post-incident reports for stakeholders.
- Improve cybersecurity response strategies through lessons learned in a simulated environment.
